## General info
This repository contains the IMDB crawler bot I coded for multiple pages of IMDB such as Movie page, Ratings page, Cast page, etc.
	
## Technologies
* Scrapy: Main framework for crawling and extrating info from web content.
* BeautifulSoup: Used in some parts of data cleaning and manipulating.
* MongoDB: All records are saved in a MongoDB instance. This allows for easily scalable storage system and robust CSV outputs.

## Additional info
It is probably better to clean the code and also probably create a decent app from it. Unfortunately, I won't be able to devote any more time to this project. Feel free to contact me should any question arise on this topic.
